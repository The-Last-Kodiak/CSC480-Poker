# MCTS Poker Bot

This is a heads-up Texas Hold’em bot that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCB1 to decide whether to **fold** or **stay** based on an estimated ≥50% win probability within a 10s time limit.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* No external packages (uses only standard library)

## Running the Bot

### Pre-flop Only

```bash
python3 PokerBot.py --hole As Ah
# Example: pocket Aces should stay
```

### Pre-flop Fold Example

```bash
python3 PokerBot.py --hole 7c 2d
# Expect: fold
```

### With Community Cards

```bash
python3 PokerBot.py --hole Kd Qd --community Ah Td 2s
```

This will:

1. Decide pre-flop.
2. Simulate a flop (3 cards) and decide pre-turn.
3. Simulate turn (1 card) and decide pre-river.
4. Simulate river (1 card) and report final MCTS win probability.

## Example Output

```
Pre-flop decision: stay
Flop: ['Ah','Td','2s']
Pre-turn decision: stay
Turn: 7c
Pre-river decision: stay
River: 5d
MCTS win probability: 0.912
```

## Notes

* The bot runs MCTS for \~10 seconds per decision.
* Hand evaluator covers all classic Hold’em categories (straight flush down to high card).
* UCB1 balances exploring different opponent-hole possibilities vs. exploiting known strong lines.
